This file contains the expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the
4.3-stable tag (the basename of this file).

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

Add new entries at the end of the file.

## Changes between 4.3-stable and 4.4-stable

GH-95374
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/ShapeCast2D/properties/collision_result': getter changed value in new API, from "_get_collision_result" to &"get_collision_result".
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/ShapeCast3D/properties/collision_result': getter changed value in new API, from "_get_collision_result" to &"get_collision_result".

These getters have been renamed to expose them. GDExtension language bindings couldn't have exposed these properties before.


GH-90993
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/RenderingDevice/methods/draw_list_begin/arguments': size changed value in new API, from 9 to 10.
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/RenderingDevice/methods/draw_list_begin/arguments/9': type changed value in new API, from "Array" to "int".
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/RenderingDevice/methods/draw_list_begin/arguments/9': default_value changed value in new API, from "Array[RID]([])" to "0".
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/RenderingDevice/methods/draw_list_begin/arguments/9': type changed value in new API, from "typedarray::RID" to "int".

draw_list_begin added a new optional debug argument called breadcrumb.
There used to be an Array argument as arg #9 initially, then changed to typedarray::RID in 4.1, and finally removed in 4.3.
Since we're adding a new one at the same location, we need to silence those warnings for 4.1 and 4.3.
